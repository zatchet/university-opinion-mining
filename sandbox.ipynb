      "title:  Frat guys talking about r*ping girls\n",
      "selftext:  I was sitting in the student center today and overheard them having one of the most disturbing conversations I've ever heard. It started out as mild locker talk; talking about some sorority girls that are moving into the apartment next to them and how it'll be “nice” to have girls that are “easy” living next to them but that they worry it will ruin their chances of getting with other girls (there was an implication that they know these girls.) Then they proceeded to complain about how you can’t tell women to lose weight anymore or else you’ll be called a bad guy (f*cking duh thats a sh*tty thing to do.) Then, they began to rate girls they knew using a fantasy football-like system, giving them each numbers based in their weight and “f*ckability.” The reason I’m making this post, however, is because of the end of their convo. One of them mentioned a girl that they're going to be bringing to a formal (I think) and how they think she’s ugly but maybe after a few drinks he’ll feel okay having s*x with her. Her name is Emma and they mentioned that she has a cape cod tattoo and is a friend of a friend.  What scared me, is that they were talking about going to Ohee and finding girls who were drunk enough to not be able to say no. They kept implying and making jokes about using drunk girls and it really scared me. I thought about calling the bar to warn them but I don't really know how to approach that and I doubt they'd do anything given idk these guys names. They seemed to be frat guys, and are on sports teams at Northeastern, although I don't know which teams. I don't recognise the sports backpacks they had. I want to say one of their names began with an L, like Leo or Levi or something. I took a picture of them from far away when I left that I wanted to post here to see if anyone knows them but it looks like I can’t add an attachment. Maybe i shouldn't have taken the picture but the convo shook me so much that I left curry crying and actually shaking with anger. I wish i said something and i feel guilty that i didn't but also there was three of them and i was scared. It truly horrifies me that there are men on our campus who speak like that freely and no one checks them. There was legitimately a table full of professors sitting next to them. Makes me absolutely sick. If youre planning on going to ohee tonight or tomorrow maybe dont. \n",

I currently have a B+ in one class (not going to say which for privacy reasons), and I really really need an A to keep my GPA above my scholarship requirement.  I recently did pretty poorly on the midterm and I’m not sure I’ll be able to get an A in the class even if I ace everything after this. \n",

      "Negative comments made against any ethnic group have ripple effects. Consider how many prospective applicants to NEU are reading these posts, how many current undergraduate students might now be the subject of uncomfortable jokes after a post goes around, and how unwelcome the graduate students must feel when they see some of the things that get posted here. Anti Indian sentiment on campus has increased significantly and it’s not okay. Do better.\n",

      "selftext:  Let me start by saying this: I’m an RA, I’m 20 (underage), I drink, I smoke pot, I go to parties, I want all of y’all to go have fun and enjoy college 100%. With that out of the way I’ll start my PSA. \n",
      "\n",
      "Jesus fucking Christ you guys need to calm down. I just talked to my residence director so all this info is at least pretty verifiable. There were a months worth of write ups in freshman dorms ALONE last night. Multiple ambulances called, and double digit freshman hospitalized…again, last night ALONE. \n",
      "\n",

      "You guys are partying on roofs and being shocked you get caught. You’re shotgunning beers in common rooms and wondering why you get written up. You travel in such unbelievably massive droves to Mission Hill that the BPD has told northeastern if they don’t fix it, the BPD will. You guys have no idea how abnormal this is. It’s not what you’re doing, it’s how unbelievably obvious, open, and out of control it is. The university is considering “serious crackdowns that would change day to day life” and I for one would love to see that not happen. \n",
      "\n",
      "So peace of advice: walk to the hill in groups of 5, not 30. Don’t drink or smoke in visible places (or just go to the damn fens). If you’re doing stuff in the dorm, head to someone’s room and just don’t Blair music too loud, nobody will bother you I promise. Please take care of each other when you drink, and sleep on your side or stomach. And just generally speaking, at least try not to get caught. \n",
