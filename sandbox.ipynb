      "So judging by the state of the subreddit, we've all seen the announcement about the fall (yay!), but there are of course people who are nervous or have questions about the vaccines.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I happen to know a little bit about this stuff (my specialty is viral evolution), so I'm going to try to provide some info and if anyone has any questions, try to answer them.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "So these are RNA vaccines, meaning they bring a little bit of RNA into your cells. RNA (or mRNA, if you want to be more specific) is the stuff that's \"read\" by your cells to make proteins. In this case, we're giving our cells the instructions to make a viral protein, which our immune system can then see and go \"A HA, viral protein!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we make antibodies and T cells for that protein, so if you happen to be exposed to the real thing, you're ready to go. As always, [there's an xkcd for this.](https://xkcd.com/2425/)\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "The RNA doesn't do much in your cells. It only last about five minutes before it breaks down. It can't modify your DNA. Once it's gone, these vaccines work like a lot of others in that there are viral proteins present that can't hurt you, but your immune system can target them in preparation for the real thing. The only difference is that instead of these viral proteins being injected (like a yearly flu vaccine, for example), your cells made them.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "Are there side effects? In many people, yes. BUT! They're mostly things like aches or a mild fever, and those are good side effects, because those things are your immune system ramping up. And because these vaccines are prepared differently from others (like the flue shot, for example), I've read that people are less likely to have allergic reactions (I'm not a medical doctor consult a medical doctor if you've had an allergic reaction to a vaccine in the past).\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "These vaccines work REALLY well. 95% effective means that for any given activity, your risk of contracting a COVID infection is reduced by 95% if you are vaccinated. It doesn't mean 5% of vaccinated people get COVID, or that there's a 5% chance of getting COVID if you're vaccinated. It's a reduction in risk. So if you think of everything you do as a probability distribution, some things are very safe, some things are less so. Once you're vaccinated, take every point on that curve and drop it by 95%. That's what 95% efficacy means for a vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I should note that that is *incredible*. A *really good* flu vaccine is like 70% effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does this protection last? We’re not sure. There are 4 coronaviruses that circulate all the time and cause a common cold. Immunity to those lasts 1-3 years, and depends on how long you continue to respond to the virus and how much the virus changes. In general, responses in younger people remain stronger for longer. These vaccines are designed to be more robust than a natural infection (hence the side effects), so while we don’t yet know for sure, the ability to respond to the virus will probably last at least a few years (and this is why you should get vaccinated even if you had COVID – protection from the vaccine will be stronger and last longer than what you get from a natural infection).\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the question of how long they will be protective will hinge on how much the virus changes. So far, the vaccines are effective against the new variants circulating. I could see a future where we get a combo flu/COVID shot every fall to keep up with the newest variants. Nobody knows for sure, but I wouldn’t be surprised. That shouldn't be too challenging, from a technical perspective, now that we have the vaccines in the first place. Modifying that is a lot easier than, you know, inventing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "So. Once you can, please get vaccinated. Remote teaching sucks compared to in person. These vaccines are safe, effective, and basically marvels of biotechnology.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",

      "\n",
      "One more edit: Want to add a bit about herd immunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people can't get vaccinated. People may be allergic to the vaccine, or immunocompromised, or some other reason. So they're vulnerable to the virus as long as it's circulating.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what we want to do is for everyone else to get vaccinated, which prevents the virus from circulating. Once a high enough percentage are vaccinated, there aren't enough vulnerable hosts for the virus to persist in the population - this is called \"herd immunity\". We can actually calculate what that threshold is: 1-(1/R0), where R0 is the average number of people infected from a single infected person in a completely susceptible population. For this virus, if I recall, R0 is between 3 and 4. So let's say it's 4 - that means we need 1-(1/4) = 3/4 = 0.75 = 75% of the population vaccinated to prevent it from circulating. These numbers are approximate, get the actual numbers from public health sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "This works because a vaccinated person is MUCH less likely to be infected - 95% less likely for Pfizer and Moderna - and also MUCH less likely to transmit the virus if they are infected - about 90% less likely based on the data so far. So for a vaccinated person, that's 1/10th (transmission) of 1/20th (infection), or just 1/200th, as likely to be a link in a transmission chain between two unvaccinated people, compared to an unvaccinated person. That's a huge difference. So when a sufficient threshold of the population is vaccinated, the virus cannot circulate, and the people who can't get vaccinated are protected.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what needs to happen for things to go back to \"normal\", which is why everyone who is not medically unable to get the vaccine should get it as soon as they are eligible. \n",

During my time researching, it became apparent that there are other related organizations like NJPIRG operating in other states, collecting fees from university students and diverting funds to USPIRG and other afflilate organizations. Student opposition to their state/university chapters of PIRG were widely documented. While the chances are slim for this report to spur anything else, I have provided this report and some context to some national news outlets with venerable investigative teams for further investigations of other state PIRGs and how all of this links together.\n",
