      "score:  1461\n",
      "selftext:  I was sitting in the student center today and overheard them having one of the most disturbing conversations I've ever heard. It started out as mild locker talk; talking about some sorority girls that are moving into the apartment next to them and how it'll be “nice” to have girls that are “easy” living next to them but that they worry it will ruin their chances of getting with other girls (there was an implication that they know these girls.) Then they proceeded to complain about how you can’t tell women to lose weight anymore or else you’ll be called a bad guy (f*cking duh thats a sh*tty thing to do.) Then, they began to rate girls they knew using a fantasy football-like system, giving them each numbers based in their weight and “f*ckability.” The reason I’m making this post, however, is because of the end of their convo. One of them mentioned a girl that they're going to be bringing to a formal (I think) and how they think she’s ugly but maybe after a few drinks he’ll feel okay having s*x with her. Her name is Emma and they mentioned that she has a cape cod tattoo and is a friend of a friend.  What scared me, is that they were talking about going to Ohee and finding girls who were drunk enough to not be able to say no. They kept implying and making jokes about using drunk girls and it really scared me. I thought about calling the bar to warn them but I don't really know how to approach that and I doubt they'd do anything given idk these guys names. They seemed to be frat guys, and are on sports teams at Northeastern, although I don't know which teams. I don't recognise the sports backpacks they had. I want to say one of their names began with an L, like Leo or Levi or something. I took a picture of them from far away when I left that I wanted to post here to see if anyone knows them but it looks like I can’t add an attachment. Maybe i shouldn't have taken the picture but the convo shook me so much that I left curry crying and actually shaking with anger. I wish i said something and i feel guilty that i didn't but also there was three of them and i was scared. It truly horrifies me that there are men on our campus who speak like that freely and no one checks them. There was legitimately a table full of professors sitting next to them. Makes me absolutely sick. If youre planning on going to ohee tonight or tomorrow maybe dont. \n",

When the student government attempted to reach out to the student body to inform them of the current policy and the legislation that we passed, we were blocked. The Office of student affairs prevented the student government from contacting the student body about this issue. The worst part is that the justification for why the policy won’t be changed is that not enough students have complained to the office of the provost.

Everything I say is just my personal opinion of course. Also 10/10 does not mean they are 10/10 compared to other non-Wollaston's sandwiches/delis. 10/10 just means it is one of the best sandwiches you can get at Wollaston's\n",
      "\n",
      "**Boston Connection (9/10):** Starting off with an absolute banger. The roast beef is easily the best cold cut meat at the deli and the thousand island is one of the best sauces. I personally always take the tomato off because I hate tomatoes on cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches are supposed to be easy to eat and not messy, but tomatoes just leak everywhere when you bite into them. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Fenway (3.5/10):** Pretty underwhelming, but expected this one to be bad. Deli turkey is just not that good, already said my part about tomatoes, lettuce/cucumbers/mayo are just the most boring and bland final three toppings. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Gobbler (4/10)**: I know that many people love this sandwich, but not me. The stuffing is good, turkey is bland, and cranberry sauce just doesn't taste good mixed with mayo. Not only that, but they never put enough mayo in this one and the sandwich is just so dry \n",
      "\n",
      "**Green Monster (7/10):** It's another turkey sandwich but this one has guac, which is great, and muenster cheese, the second best cheese they have to offer. I dislike having pickles in this, I think it's a weird choice given the other ingredients, and it really does clash in terms of flavor.\n",

      "**Huntington (8.5/10):** Easily the best turkey sandwich for one reason: Brie. Brie cheese obviously is amazing with anything, but it works really well with turkey especially because the subtle flavor of the turkey doesn't clash or overwhelm the Brie. However the honey mustard at Wollastons' is really bad, it's my least favorite sauce they have. It leans way too much into mustard/sour and not enough into honey/sweet. I always sub it out with thousand island\n",

      "\n",
      "**Punta Cana (8.5/10):** This is actually one of my favorite sandwiches, but only when you replace the honey mustard with thousand island (and remove the tomatoes of course, since it's a cold cut sandwich). The honey ham and buffalo chicken combo is superb. Pepperjack cheese is the correct choice of cheese to complement these ingredients as well**.**\n",

      "\n",
      "**Veggie Delight (4/10):** I tried like one bite of this a long time ago when my girlfriend got it but I remember being surprised that it wasn't a straight 0. But it has two great cheeses and thousand island dressing so it isn't that horrible. Tomatoes in a cold sandwich and a lack of meat make it below average though. Still, sandwiches like the Fenway and Italian Job should be ashamed they're worse than a meatless sandwich\n",

      "**Tuscano (2/10):** Add this thing to that previous list of ashamed sandwiches too because it's just god awful. Worst Wollaston's sandwich. Even the mozzarella can't save it\n",
      "\n",
      "**Wentworth (6.5/10):** It's not bad, replace the honey mustard and remove the tomatoes and it gets a lot better. Honey turkey/honey ham combo is just a worse version of honey ham though\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tuna Salad (7.5/10):** I've never had the chicken or egg salad sandwiches. I love tuna salad. You pick your own toppings for this one. They let you take two containers from the display and that's what they make it with, so the amount of tuna salad on it is pretty generous. Good stuff\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pulled Pork**: Never tried\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Mookie BATS (4/10):** It's just a BLT basically, with spinach instead of lettuce. I'm actually not the world's biggest BLT fan because I think bacon should never be the primary meat on a sandwich. It doesn't pack enough of a punch on it's own because you can't put enough of it down to cover the whole sandwich area without making it too greasy\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Ninja** **(10/10)**: Second perfect score. The sriracha honey is so good, the combination of that and guac is just perfect. Pepperjack is also the perfect cheese for this. Even the tomato is good because it's a hot and messy sandwich already so it doesn't matter if tomato juice leaks out\n",
      "\n",
      "**The George Likes His Chicken Spicy (9/10)**: This is misleading because it's not spicy at all, Mike's Hot Honey is simply just not spicy. This is basically The Ninja's less spicy cousin. Bacon is awesome on this.\n",

      "**Game of Thrones (8/10):** Really good spicy sandwich. Lots of great flavors come together in this but not all of them work together (BBQ?). Still great though\n",

      "**Lighten Up Francis (10/10):** My go to. Simple but amazing. The grilled chicken slaps. Avocado always hits, chipotle mayo is a great sauce. Don't have to change a thing for this one to be good.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chicken & Prosciutto (4/10):** It's disappointing although the name sounds good. I like the pesto, but the one time I got this the chicken was fried really dry and salty, and the prosciutto amplified that. \n",

So without further ado:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Problem:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **26% of Northeastern students** **have stated that they have faced food insecurity on campus.** The Massachusetts rate of food insecurity is 12.5%.\n",
      "* **Northeastern's Meal Plan is ridiculously (and prohibitively) expensive.** At $7,910 per year for a 17-meal-per-week plan, NEU's meal plan is $3,410 more expensive than the national average.\n",
      "* **Swipe2Care is a broken solution.** Not only is it ridiculous that Northeastern relies on students to end the hunger of other students, but the system itself is broken.\n",
      "   * Students can be rejected arbitrarily from receiving a swipe, and those who do get swipes often wait up to a week to receive them.\n",
      "   * Very few people will remember to donate their swipes into the Swipe2Care pool. There is no reason that unused swipes should not be automatically transferred to the Swipe2Care pool.\n",
      "* **Dining Halls have insufficient capacity to meet student needs.**\n",
      "   * We all see it. The dining hall workers are overworked and dining capacity is abysmal.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Our Proposed Solution**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Guaranteed 3 Meals/Day** for all students in meal-plan-required housing at no cost.\n",
      "   1. **Reducing the cost of meal plans/profiler meals** for those who have kitchens. We are proposing a 24% reduction in meal plan costs across the board to bring parity to the BU meal plan.\n",
      "2. **Ending Food Waste on Campus**. Thousands of pounds of ingredients go unused and are sold off to feed manufacturers. Considering the pay that dining workers get ($6-7 less/hour than MIT and Harvard dining workers) and the displacement they have experienced due to Northeastern's gentrification, many workers struggle to put food on the table. Dining workers should be receiving first pick on leftover ingredients to take home. All excess food should be donated to local food pantries, including NU Mutual Aid. Any leftover food should be directed towards increased composting initiatives.\n",
      "3. **Meet the demands of the Dining Union**. Dining workers will soon be renegotiating their contract via their union. Northeastern must accept their demands.\n",

Endorsements can be made at[ https://www.nohungryhuskies.com/endorse-the-campaign](https://www.nohungryhuskies.com/endorse-the-campaign)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Don't most students not use 3 meals/day?** Most students on a 17-meal-per-week will tell you that they usually have a swipe or so leftover by the end of the week. We treat access to food as a human right, not something that must be rationed and worried over. Our goal in this campaign is to make sure that when people need 3 meals in a day, they won't have to ration their food on other days. Additionally, implementing a no-excuse, automatic Swipe2Care program would be built largely on the excess swipes that go unused on a day-to-day basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why a**[ **petition**](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/no-hungry-huskies-food-for-all)**?** Petitions are an extremely useful tool for spreading awareness about an issue and preventing the university from publicly stating that they are (1) unaware of an issue (2) unaware of student support of an issue. It is important to note that we do not anticipate the petition being the end all be all of the campaign. An awareness campaign is only step one, and it is extremely important that we get as many students as possible plugged in and publicly stating their support.\n",

      "I am here to answer a question that needs to be asked, DOES AMELIAS SECRETLY OVERCHARGE YOU? Now this may seem like an odd question, but my experiences over the last semester have made me question their morals as a restaurant. \n",
      "\n",
      "This post is driven by an experience that I had tonight, and many others like it. My friends have had similar interactions as well.\n",
      "\n",
      " I walked in and ordered my favorite Burrito, extra large with Carnitas, lettuce, pico, mild salsa and corn. Yum. This is something that I have ordered many times in the past. It consists of the Burrito itself, which costs $7.50. It is 65 extra cents for carnitas, as well as 25 cents extra for corn. This brings our total to $8.40, and after Massachusetts' 6.25% tax, our grand total is $8.93, right? WRONG. According to the mathematicians at Amelias Taqueria, my burrito cost at total of $10.80. WTF. It was at this point that I had already handed the cashier my credit card, as I had not really been paying attention to the screen on the cash register. She swiped my card before I could protest and handed it back to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "As this was happening, I got hit with some Deja-Vu shit. This had happened MANY times before, where I was charged in the range of $9.30-10$ for the EXACT SAME BURRITO that  had ordered on this very night. Each time I thought I had been overcharged I would confront the cashier, and each time, my order was lowered anywhere from 25 cents to a dollar, with no apology or sense of regret for making a mistake. It continued to happen, but I figured I would just have to keep an eye out when paying. When I saw the register display $10.80 on this fateful night, I began to think something fishy was up. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why is my burrito $10.80?\" I asked. She responded that I had ordered guacamole, sour cream, and mango salsa, which all cost an additional amount of money. This was simply not true. I had literally ordered 20 seconds ago and watched as the guy had put none of those things on my burrito. But no big deal, I figured she would check with the server who made my burrito and then apologize for putting my order in wrong and at least offer to pay me my $2 back, or promise it wouldn't happen again. But no. She told me that although I was right, that I had not in fact ordered sour cream, guacamole, and mango salsa, that the corn was now $3. WHAT? It says on the board that it is 25 cents. I told her that was wrong, and that there's no way my burrito should cost that much. But nope. Corn was still 3$. I protested this profusely, but in a calm manner. I did not raise my voice, but I did continue to ask her why I was being charged an absurd amount for corn. \n",
      "\n",
      "I guess she realized that she had already swiped my card, because it was at this point she stopped responding to me. I grilled her a little harder, but she continued ignoring me, hoping I'd leave. 3-4 of the staff gathered around her as I continued to stand there and talk, waiting for a response. I asked one of them for help, even the guy that had seconds ago MADE MY BURRITO. I asked him to verify my story. But blank stares was all I got. Maybe I should have opened up my burrito and shown her that I wasn't lying. Probably wouldn't have changed a thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look, I don't need my two dollars back.\" I said. \" Whatever. I would just like an apology for being overcharged and for it to not happen again.\" Again, no response. As I was talking, the cashier had picked up the phone and started talking to a customer, completely ignoring me. The rest of the staff continued to stare, oblivious to the growing line of customers. \n",
      "\n",
      "By now they hadn't rang up anybody else at the register for about 3 minutes. The line was at a standstill. I was still being ignored. They were playing the waiting game. Finally, I gave in, disgusted with how I was being treated and left. \n",

I simply wanted an apology, and a promise it wouldn't happen again. Somehow they couldn't even do that. \n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. AMELIAS WILL CHARGE YOU EXTRA- They will ring you up for items that you did not purchase. Whether it's 25 cents for the side you didn't get, or $1.50 for the mango salsa you didn't order, your order will always come out above what it should. Try this yourself. Order a burrito, and keep close track of what you got on it. I guarantee you that 50% of the time, you will find that you have been charged for an extra item. Even if it's just pennies, it will add up over time. I bet they make 2-5% of their weekly income based off of extras students didn't order.\n",
      "2. STUDENTS ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR THIS- When the cashier sees a NU student come up the line, they will charge them extra. College students are completely careless when it comes to ordering food. Whether they are drunk or high, or just stressed from classes, they are the last people who would double check the price of an order. Think about the last time you double checked your order when you were drunk at 1AM. \n",
      "3. THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED EXPERIENCE- As I said, this has happened to me many times before, just never on this scale. I have asked them on multiple occasions, at least 5, to double check the price after my order. Almost every time, it is brought down about 50 cents. I also conferred with some friends, and they seemed to notice a trend too. \n",
      "4. THEY ASSUME, AND ACT LIKE ITS AN ACCIDENT- They will always assume you ordered the most expensive items. Carnitas over chicken, Mango salsa over plain. Whatever it is, they assume in a way that benefits them. And when you question them, they act like it was an accident, or in my case, they get sweaty hands and won't talk until you leave. \n",
      "5. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE ON- Maybe they are overcharging intentionally, or maybe they actually have no clue what is going on in their own restaurant. Either way, they are taking your money. \n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "I conclude this post by saying that I will be boycotting Amelias. The food is good and it's a great place to go when it's late and you're drunk. But be weary. They pray on people like you. They know you won't check. They will take advantage of that. Of course, do as you wish. I am only writing this to try and help you. \n",

      "selftext:  This semester in Software Development with Felleisen and Lerner was nothing short of horrible. If you aren't a CS major or haven't heard of the class, let me explain. The course serves as a sort of \"fundies 4\", wherein students are meant to use the knowledge they have gained over the past 2-3 years in order to develop a large scale software project from scratch. This sounds okay in theory, but the structure of this course feels more like endless punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, students are faced with endless moving goals, such as changing assignment parameters that are fundamental to a successful project. Not only that, but the assignments are structured in such a way that you may have to rewrite code that you spent 20+ hours on the week before. The professors attempt to emulate a pseudo \"corporate\" environment, but I would argue that college is meant to build you up, not force you to break down and wonder if you picked the correct major after spending weeks on a project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only that, but if you do end up in a terrible corporate environment, it is much easier to quit, whereas this course is a requirement for anyone pursuing a CS degree. I cannot speak for everyone, but several of my colleagues mentioned that Software Dev took close to 30 hours a week, which is completely unreasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The professors are also snarky and curt for seemingly no reason. Every answer on piazza and over email feels degrading and confusing, and in some cases even misleading (intentionally or not, I don't know). There was a clear \"god-complex\" on their part, where changes to the spec were not mistakes, rather they were \"clarifications\". They preach about \"good design\" while giving half or more points to autograding, which means that the code you worked on for 40+ hours and attempted to design well could just get a 0 for the week. There was never any acknowledgement of mental health, or even that spending so much time on one class is not healthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, there are two partner switches throughout the semester, which force you to THROW AWAY the code you have worked on, and switch to another brand new codebase. It is essentially luck of the draw if you end up with a decent codebase, or if you get a codebase that is completely broken and doesn't follow the assignments at all.\n",

Administrative Hearing with a Resident Director (taking place in a dorm inside the RD office). Administrative Hearing with OSCCR Staff Member (taking place in the OSCCR office in 204 Ell Hall). Student Conduct Board meeting (not sure where these happen, I’ve only had Administrative Hearings). All three of these meetings are official OSCCR meetings, even the RD hearing. \n",

How exciting. The letter lays out the time/date/location of the meeting, along with what you are “allegedly” being charged with, and when the alleged incident took place. This letter will also tell you which one of the three aforementioned meetings you will have. If you are on co-op, the letter will ask you to contact the letter’s author within 72 hours to set up a time. They will do Skype or Phone meetings, though I would recommend in person for the full OSCCR experience. \n",

      "Back in 2014 the letter listed Levels (I to IV) to show how serious the offense was, this has sense been stopped. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you were caught with a group, immediately start a group chat and ask if they also got the letter (spoiler alert: they did), and for which charges. You then need to check the meeting times - whoever has the first meeting will be an invaluable resource to the rest of the crew. \n",
      "\n",
      "Start getting your story straight, weather just you or a group. Think really specifically about what happened during the incident, and what authority figures you interacted with. If you were blackout drunk, I get it I’ve been there; But do know if you interacted with an RA or NUPD they will record almost everything you drunkenly rambled. Hopefully a more sober friend can help you recall what was said, as your ramblings will be in the official “report” the Hearing Administrator or SCB has in front of them. \n",

      "The letter states you can \"you may reach out to a hearing advisor prior to the hearing. A list of trained hearing advisors can be found at http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/hearing-advisors/.” Personally, I never bothered with this. Just ensure you know what happened during the incident, or have an alibi (more on that in next section). \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, don’t try to email or call OSCCR to plead your case before the meeting - it makes you look desperate. If you are genuinely confused about the incident,  email the letter’s author and ask which report # it is in reference to. I once got busted for throwing a party off campus, and BPD was the complainant on the letter. I proactively reached out to get the police report #, went to BPD HQ, and made a public records request for the report. I got it, and it really helped the group going into the meeting. \n",

You can say you were leaving, asleep, not drinking, only there because one of your friends was super depressed because their goldfish just died and just trying to support them by going with them to the noisy West Village B party (I have used this), or - if the report doesn't mention you violating something by name - JUST FLAT OUT DENY IT ALL. Don't reason, JUST DENY EVERYTHING AND ADMIT NOTHING.\n",

      "After the report has been read, and you tried to DENY EVERYTHING, the OSCCR person will ask you if you want to accept responsibility for the charges. It is your choice, and you+your group may think that is the right thing to do (especially if you are clearly guilty.) That being said, I would really advise against accepting responsibility, because if you accept responsibility for any of the charges (they read them off one by one) the OSCCR person will negate anything you  previously said and just give you the sanctions. Do not accept responsibility. \n",

I’ve been unlucky, living with a rambunctious group for three years - and usually taking the blame. That being said, I probably did deserve to go to OSCCR at least 60% of the time.

The \"North East Arrow\" ↗ (which shall henceforth be referred to as U+2197), is a Unicode character that has its origins in Unicode 1.1 from 1993, and was added as an emoji in Emoji 1.0 in 2015. Let's use it in the university's official acronym.\n",

      "### PROS\n",
      "\n",
      "* U+2197 is universally supported across devices, just as easily as the small dash \"-\" is (U+2013). It does not suffer from much platform-dependent rendering like many emojis do.\n",
      "* Only having 1898 to remember is too easy. U+2197 will double the amount of 4 digit numbers the freshman have to memorize for trivia ice breakers!\n",
      "* At 27 years old, U+2197 is older than most current students and many of the buildings on campus. It's practically a historical artifact, and ↗ern ought to treasure and preserve what few such pieces of history it has.\n",
      "* The university is in dire need of a new acronym. \"NEU\" (bleh) promotes the horrendous misconception that the university's name has more words than it does, while \"NU\" (double bleh) is too generic and leads to confusion with other universities such as Nebraska and Northwestern. Even beyond those, a simple google search for \"nu college\" also turns up Neumann, National, Niagara, and Northwest Universities before ↗ern.\n",
      "* Selecting one acronym \"to rule them all\" will harmonize the university between the various clans representing NEU, NU, and even NeU. How many more lives must be lost in this endless tribal conflict before U+2197 is recognized as a savior??!\n",
      "* With no obvious pronunciation, U+2197 will leave opposing universities' small-brained sporting followers with few options to twist our acronym into derogatory chants during games. Sucks to BU, indeed!\n",
      "* U+2197's beautiful, upward-sloping direction will signal to the world the positive path that ↗ern is currently traveling!\n",

      "selftext:  The working conditions at Marino have gone down the drain. A Fitness Consultant (FC) came to work at 5:15am (commute time of around 20 mins since it’s off campus housing, few minutes for personal hygiene, so assuming he left home at 4:45am) today and worked until 11am. The person went to get a sandwich from Wolly towards the middle of his shift cuz you know he is human and hunger is real. He barely took 5 mins get his sandwich. Pretty sure people can survive 5 minutes without an FC on the floor. Anyways, senior management saw him get his sandwich and told him that’s not allowed (sure, if you are following the law, you are not allowed to work more than 6 hours continuously without taking a break). They reiterated this by writing a pass on for the rest of the staff to see. But like wtf, it’s just a sandwich. The kid didn’t fight back and just stood there taking shit from management because he/she needs this job to get by.\n",
      "For those of you that can’t relate, these people are not allowed to sit down (even for a second) during their shift because Northeastern can’t afford a chair for their employees? It is noteworthy to point out that most of the students working at Marino are international students. They only do this mundane and frankly condescending job because they need the money to get thru college. They aren’t allowed to participate in work study and aren’t allowed to work off campus. It is next to impossible to find a job on campus.\n",

      "selftext:  It has become apparent that quite a few people on this reddit page are not taking this pandemic seriously. I’ve seen a few people write about them not caring if they get the virus because they are young and healthy and won’t die even though we are seeing that isn’t really the case anymore. But even if you don’t care about getting it yourself, you should care about spreading it to other people. Imagine getting the virus and being asymptomatic and then spreading it to innocent people who have been taking the precautions and following the guidelines. How could one not fear doing that? I would feel so guilty if I ever did that and if that alone doesn’t make people follow the guidelines it says a lot about their characters but I’ll give you another perspective. Think about this, if precautions aren’t taken and guidelines aren’t followed Northeastern will once again close campus. This means that because of people’s disregard for others we will be deprived of in person learning and will not be able to be with our friends for months. You won’t need to worry about the new guest policy because we won’t be on campus. Those whose last semester it is at Northeastern will be spending it at home. Is not following the precautions and guidelines worth it? If people will just follow the guidelines and take the precautions we can actually have a good semester. We can be with our friends, attend in-person classes, and get back to some sort of normalcy. PLEASE FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES AND TAKE THE PRECAUTIONS. WEAR A MASK. WASH YOUR HANDS. SOCIAL DISTANCE.\n",
