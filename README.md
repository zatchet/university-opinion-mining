University Sentiment Analysis provides users with the means to discover public sentiment towards specific university-related topics. While one can easily search the web for factual information on something, hearing real opinions from real people that are a part of that community is often more difficult, and more valuable. This tool simplifies that process by consuming user queries in a natural language chat interface and performing retrieval-augmented generation using Reddit to give informed responses with links to relevant content.
